## 📖 Abstract

The traditional manual system for maintaining student records, book data, and managing accounts is inefficient and error-prone. Students face challenges like:

- Difficulty finding specific books  
- Uncertainty about book availability  
- No tracking of return schedules  
- No ISBN-based search

This **Library Management System** eliminates these problems by automating all core functions of a library.
